  Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description

  The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing

  - No variables have been created, add cloud variables on the Thing Setup page
    to see them declared here

  Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
  which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
  These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.

     The following function allows you to obtain more information
